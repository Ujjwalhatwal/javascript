// fetch api : The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for XMLHttpRequest.

//The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers — even if the server response is an HTTP error status. You can also optionally pass in an init options object as the second argument (see Request).
// fetch has highest priority queue : microtask queue
