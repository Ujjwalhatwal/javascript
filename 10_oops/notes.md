<!-- javascript has classes 
     Yes, JavaScript has classes, introduced in ES6 (2015), which provide a cleaner and more structured syntax for creating objects and implementing inheritance. However, 
     
     JavaScript is fundamentally prototype-based, so classes are essentially syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance model. This means that while you can use class syntax similar to other object-oriented languages like Java or Python, 
     
     under the hood JavaScript still relies on prototypes to manage inheritance and object behavior.

## âœ… OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)

* OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which are collections of **properties (data)** and **methods (functions)** that operate on that data.
* Example: `"hello".toLowerCase()` â€“ Here, `"hello"` is a string object, and `toLowerCase()` is its method.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why Use OOP?

* Makes code **modular**, **reusable**, and **easier to maintain**.
* Helps in modeling real-world entities with clear structure.
* Encourages **clean code organization** through encapsulation and abstraction.
* Enables **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, which reduce redundancy and increase flexibility.

## ðŸ§© Parts of OOP in JavaScript

1. **Object Literal** â€“ Simple way to create a single object with properties and methods.
2. **Constructor Function** â€“ A function used to create multiple instances of objects with shared structure.
3. **Prototypes** â€“ Allow sharing methods between instances without duplicating them in memory.
4. **Classes** â€“ Introduced in ES6 as syntactic sugar over prototypes for writing more readable OOP code.
5. **Instances (new, this)** â€“ Objects created from classes or constructor functions using the `new` keyword; `this` refers to the specific instance.

## ðŸ”‘ Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Abstraction**
   Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
   *Example*: A car has a start button (you donâ€™t need to know how the engine works internally).

2. **Encapsulation**
   Bundling data (properties) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (object), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
   *Example*: Using private fields or closures to protect internal object state.

3. **Inheritance**
   Mechanism where one class (child) can inherit properties and methods from another (parent), enabling code reuse.
   *Example*: A `Student` class can inherit from a `Person` class.

4. **Polymorphism**
   Ability to use a single interface or method in different ways.
   *Example*: Different objects can have a method with the same name but behave differently when called.
